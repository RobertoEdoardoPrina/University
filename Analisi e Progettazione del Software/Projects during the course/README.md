# Laboratory 1:
In this laboratory, we introduced the use of Rational Software Architect Designer (RSAD), a tool for modeling and designing software applications. We used RSAD to create a UML model for a telephone directory management application. We defined use cases for the system, including contact insertion, removal, and update, as well as contact search. We also defined an administrator user who can monitor the activities of other users. Finally, we exported the use case diagram and produced detailed descriptions of some use cases.

# Laboratory 2:
In this laboratory, we extended the work from Laboratory 1 by creating a domain model for the telephone directory system. We defined the main entities of the system, including User, Directory, Contact, and Administrator. We added attributes to these classes and defined the associations between them. Finally, we exported the domain model.

# Laboratory 3:
The third laboratory concludes the analysis section of the telephone directory system, presenting system sequence diagrams (SSD) and contracts. It also introduces the design part by defining the logical architecture.

# Laboratory 4:
In the fourth laboratory, we completed the design of the telephone directory system. We created interaction diagrams and project classes for the system. We modeled the "insertNewContact" operation through a sequence diagram. The DirectoryController acts as a mediator between the user interface and the domain. The Directory class handles contact creation. We added associations and attributes to the classes. The assignment also requires the creation of sequence diagrams for the "insertContactData" and "insertContactNumber" operations.
