# University Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my university journey. Here, you will find a variety of projects spanning different fields and disciplines, including programming, software engineering, and data analysis.

These projects were undertaken as part of university courses and demonstrate my ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical situations. Each project is contained within a separate directory and includes source code, documentation, and any additional resources.
